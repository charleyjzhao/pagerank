# PageRank

This repo contains files that implement a basic model of Google's famous PageRank algorithm for assigning scores to webpages in the internet. 

I have implemented PageRank in three different paradigms:
1. Standard Python (standard_pagerank.ipynb)
2. MapReduce (mrjob_pagerank.py)
3. PySpark (pyspark_pagerank.ipynb)
